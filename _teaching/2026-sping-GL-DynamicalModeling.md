Guest lecture in the course Bioinspired Robot Design and Experimentation taught by Dr. Victoria A. Webster-Wood. In this lecture, I cover dynamical models and simulations, introducing students to Lagrangian mechanics, various simulation tools, and the process of demand-driven complexity. I also provide a high-level overview of control theory.
