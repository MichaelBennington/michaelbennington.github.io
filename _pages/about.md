Hello and welcome! My name is Michael Bennington, and I am a current Mechanical Engineering PhD student in the [Biohybrid and Organic Robotics Group](https://engineering.cmu.edu/borg/index.html) at Carnegie Mellon University. My current research focuses on the biomechanics and neural control of multifunctional feeding behaviors in the sea slug <i>Aplysia californica</i>. My work is supported by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.

<b>As I approach the end of my PhD program, I am looking for opportunities to continue my research career as a post-doctoral fellow or tenure track faculty member. </b>

I graduated from the University of California, San Diego with a B.S. in Bioengineering. During my degree, I conducted research under the guidance of Dr. Daniela Valdez-Jasso. In the DVJ Lab, my work focused on the mechanical testing and constitutive model of the right ventricular myocardium and extracellular matrix in a rat model of pulmonary hypertension.
