Supplying continuous power is a major challenge in the creation and deployment of sensors and small robots for marine applications. Glucose-based enzymatic fuel cells (EFCs) are a possible solution for sustainably powering such devices when mounted on or implanted in living organisms. The two main barriers to developing implantable EFCs for marine organisms are their power output and <i>in vivo</i> feasibility. Ideally, an <i>in vivo</i> EFC should be minimally invasive, remain mechanically secure, and output relatively consistent power over a predefined lifespan, ranging from weeks to months. The shape and chemistry of EFC electrodes can each contribute to or detract from the overall power production potential of the cells. This paper assesses the feasibility of EFCs using the marine sea slug, <i>Aplysia californica</i>’s, hemolymph as an analyte and presents methods to enhance the power produced by EFCs by altering their chemistry and form factor. We found that perfluorodecalin-soaked cathodes and spirally-rolled cells demonstrated increased power output compared to their respective control specimens. Cells tested in <i>Aplysia</i> saline mirrored the power output trends of cells tested in hemolymph but with higher power output. This work suggests the feasibility of creating implantable EFCs for marine sea slugs that could one day serve as sustainable biohybrid robotic platforms.
