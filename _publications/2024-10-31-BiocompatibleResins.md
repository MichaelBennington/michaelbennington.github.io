Biohybrid devices integrate biological and synthetic materials. The selection of an appropriate synthetic material to interface with living cells and tissues is crucial due to cellular chemical and mechanical sensitivities. As such, the stiffness of the material and its biocompatibility while in direct contact must be considered. In this study, the material properties and bio-compatibility of six commercially available, 3D printable resins (three rigid and three elastomeric) were assessed for their suitability for biohybrid actuators. To characterize the material, uniaxial tension and compression tests with post-hoc Hookean and Yeoh model analyses were conducted for both nonsterile and sterilized (ethanol-soaking or autoclaved) samples. The mechanical properties of the elastomeric resins were minimally impacted by the different sterilization techniques. However, both Phrozen AquaGray 8K and Liqcreate Bio-Med Clear rigid resins were significantly softer in tensile tests after sterilization, and AquaGray became far more ductile. Asiga Den-
taGUIDE was much more stable in its mechanical properties than the other rigid resins. It was also shown that long-term exposure to saline solutions leads to a decrease in the Youngâ€™s moduli of these rigid resins before any sterilization has occurred. The print fidelity was also assessed for nonsterile and sterilized samples via manual scoring to determine the impacts of the sterilization processes on the part fidelity. Sterilization techniques had a minimal impact on print fidelity for both elastomeric and ridged resins with
two exceptions. In both Formlabs Silicone 40A IPA/BuOAc post-treatment and Phrozen AquaGrey 8K groups, ethanol/UV-sterilization caused more degradation compared to autoclave-sterilization. In addition to the material analyses, cytotoxicity analyses using calcein AM and ethidium homodimer-1 fluorescence markers were conducted by directly culturing C2C12, a common myoblast cell line used in bioactuators, with sterilized resin samples. Of the elastomeric resins, only Formlabs Silicone 40A was shown to have minimal impacts on cell viability. For the rigid resins, Asiga DentaGUIDE, Liqcreate Bio-Med Clear, and ethanol-sterilized Phrozen AquaGray 8K demonstrated minimal impacts on cell viability. Based on these analyses, Asiga DentaGUIDE and Formlabs Silicone 40A demonstrate potential for applications in biohybrid muscle-based actuators when using low-cost 3D printers.
