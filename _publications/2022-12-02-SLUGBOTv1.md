Living systems can use a single periphery to perform a variety of tasks and adapt to a dynamic environment. This multifunctionality is achieved through the use of neural circuitry that adaptively controls the reconfigurable musculature. Current robotic systems struggle to flexibly adapt to unstructured environments. Through mimicry of the neuromechanical coupling seen in living organisms, robotic systems could potentially achieve greater autonomy. The tractable neuromechanics of the sea slug <i>Aplysia californica</i>’s feeding apparatus, or buccal mass, make it an ideal candidate for applying neuromechanical principles to the control of a soft robot. In this work, a robotic grasper was designed to mimic specific morphology of the <i>Aplysia</i> feeding apparatus. These include the use of soft actuators akin to biological muscle, a deformable grasping surface, and a similar muscular architecture. A previously developed Boolean neural controller was then adapted for the control of this soft robotic system. The robot was capable of qualitatively replicating swallowing behavior by cyclically ingesting a plastic tube. The robot’s normalized translational and rotational kinematics of the odontophore followed profiles observed <i>in vivo</i> despite morphological differences. This brings <i>Aplysia</i>-inspired control <i>in roboto</i> one step closer to multifunctional neural control schema <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in silico</i>. Future additions may improve SLUGBOT’s viability as a neuromechanical research platform.
