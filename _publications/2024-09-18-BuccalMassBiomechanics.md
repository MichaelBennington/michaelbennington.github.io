To understand how behaviors arise in animals, it is necessary to investigate both the neural circuits and the biomechanics of the periphery. A tractable model system for studying multifunctional control is the feeding apparatus of the marine mollusk <i>Aplysia californica</i>. Previous <i>in silico</i> and <i>in roboto</i> models have investigated how the nervous and muscular systems interact in this system. However, these models are still limited in their ability to match <i>in vivo</i> data both qualitatively and quantitatively. We introduce a new neuromechanical model of <i>Aplysia</i> feeding that combines a modified version of a previously developed neural model with a novel biomechanical model that better reflects the anatomy and kinematics of <i>Aplysia</i> feeding. The model was calibrated using a combination of previously measured biomechanical parameters and hand-tuning to behavioral data. Using this model, simulation feeding experiments were conducted, and the resulting behavioral metrics were compared to animal data. The model successfully produces three key behaviors seen in <i>Aplysia</i> and demonstrates a good quantitative agreement with biting and swallowing behaviors. Additional work is needed to match rejection behavior quantitatively and to reflect qualitative observations related to the relative contributions of two key muscles, the hinge and I3. Future improvements will focus on incorporating the effects of deformable 3D structures in the simulated buccal mass.
